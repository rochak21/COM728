# COM728-assignment
# HR Analytics System

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive HR Analytics System developed as part of the Programming for Problem Solving (COM728) module at Solent University. The system processes and analyzes employment data within a company using Python, focusing on data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.

## Features
The system is divided into three main components:

### 1. Data Retrieval (Basic Python & CSV Module)
- Employee information retrieval based on Employee Number
- Department-specific information lookup based on Job Role
- Filtered employee data based on Standard Hours and Department
- Filtered employee data absed on Education level
  
### 2. Data Analysis (Pandas)
- Analysis of top 3 job roles by education level
- Calculation of average monthly rates by education level
- Department-specific employment duration analysis
- Analyse data absed on business travel

### 3. Data Visualization (Matplotlib)
- Education level distribution visualization
- Employee training frequency analysis by education field
- Job satisfaction analysis across departments and job levels
- Comapring mmonthly income absed on education level
